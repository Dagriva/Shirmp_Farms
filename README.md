# Shirmp_Farms

The purpose of these two scrips is to generate an image classification of the shrimp pond in the Gulf of California. 
Is important to highlight that after the image classification a water mask for each year was applied to leaving the shrimp pond and deleting the permanent or temporary water bodies.  The Scripts were constructed from different examples on the web.
